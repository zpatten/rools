h2. Rools Developer Documentation

h3. Getting into Rools

A good starting point is studying the "rools.rb":../examples/rools.rb example.

The next step would be to browse the unit tests. They show all the aspects of the inference engine.

If you get lost in the terminology, you can consult the "glossary":glossary.html


h3. Running the Unit Tests

<em>Note :</em> Rools is developed and tested on MacOSX (<em>ruby 1.8.5 (2006-12-25 patchlevel 12) [i686-darwin8.8.3]</em>, this environment was built following the fine instructions from Dan Benjamin at "Hivelogic":http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx)

Following the Rake tradition, you can run the unit tests from your openwfe-ruby tree with

<pre>
    rake test
</pre>

You can run tests one at a time with 

<pre>

    rake test TEST=test/facts_test.rb

</pre>

h3. Running the Specification Tests Automatically

This will run the tests everytime a file is changed.  You can also install Growl/growlnotify to get alerted if a test fails.
For more information, please check: "Getting started with Autotest - Continuous Testing":http://ph7spot.com/articles/getting_started_with_autotest
<pre>
    rake spec:autotest
</pre>

h3. Running the Specification Tests Manually

Rools is using "RSpec":http://rspec.rubyforge.org/
You need to install the rspec gem on your system with a few others such as "rcov":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rcov/

You can run specification tests with 
<pre>
    rake specs
</pre>

or if you want full coverage analysis with:
<pre>
    rake rcov
</pre>
This will generate the "coverage report":./output/coverage/index.html and the "specifcation report":./output/rspec_report.html

h3. Required Gems for Rake

The Rakefile for rools uses 'rote' and several of its filters to produce documentation. To avoid errors or
incorrect markup processing, please install the following gems:
*   gem install redcloth
*   gem install syntax
*   gem install rote
*   gem install rspec
*   gem install rcov
*	gem install ZenTest

h4. Tool versions

If you have problems running tests or specs, please check your configuration
*  ruby --version
*  rake --version
*  rails --version
*  gem list rspec
*  gem list rubygems-update
*  gem list rote
*  gem list redcloth
*  gem list syntax
*  gem list rcov
*  gem list ZenTest

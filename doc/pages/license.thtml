This is a "BSD license":http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php , one of the most business friendly licenses.
  

Here is an excerpt from an "article":http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/11/18/licenses.html written by Stephen Fishman :

<pre>
   (...) the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) License. One of the
   earliest nonproprietary licenses, it permits users to do virtually
   anything they want with BSD-licensed code: they may distribute the
   software - either for free or commercially - without providing the
   source code; they also may modify it and distribute the changes
   without providing the source code. Anyone can turn software
   distributed under no-copyleft licenses into proprietary software (and
   then relicense it for a fee) as long as they credit the developers of
   the original open source software.

Rools is not licensed under the GPL or the LGPL. It's licensed under
the BSD license, which is way more business-friendly than the GPL or
the LGPL. And it's BSD licensed since the day 0.
